# Getting Started with Cover-Bouncer

This guide will help you set up Cover-Bouncer in your .NET project in just a few minutes.

## Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0 SDK or later
- A .NET project with tests
- Coverlet for coverage collection (or willingness to add it)

## Installation

### Step 1: Install the NuGet Package

In your test project, run:

```bash
dotnet add package CoverBouncer.MSBuild
```

This is the only package you need! It includes everything required for coverage policy enforcement.

### Step 2: Initialize Configuration

Generate a default configuration file:

```bash
dotnet coverbouncer init
```

This creates `coverbouncer.json` in your solution root with sensible defaults:

```json
{
  "coverageReportPath": "TestResults/coverage.json",
  "defaultProfile": "NoCoverage",
  "profiles": {
    "Critical": { "minLine": 1.00 },
    "BusinessLogic": { "minLine": 0.80 },
    "Standard": { "minLine": 0.60 },
    "Dto": { "minLine": 0.00 },
    "NoCoverage": { "minLine": 0.00 }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** The default is `NoCoverage` (0%) so your build won't fail on first install. Tag files with stricter profiles to opt-in to coverage enforcement.

**That's all the configuration you need!** No sprawl, no complexity.

## 🎨 Important: Profiles Are YOUR Choice!

**You are NOT limited to these profile names or percentages!** The templates above are just suggestions.

### Customize to Match Your Reality

Feel free to change profile names and thresholds to match your team's current state:

```json
{
  "defaultProfile": "WorkInProgress",
  "profiles": {
    "MustHaveTests": { "minLine": 0.45 },      // Start where you are!
    "TryingHarder": { "minLine": 0.30 },
    "SecurityStuff": { "minLine": 0.75 },      // Your own names!
    "LegacyCode": { "minLine": 0.10 },         // Be honest
    "NewCode": { "minLine": 0.80 },            // Higher bar for new work
    "EventuallyTest": { "minLine": 0.0 }
  }
}
```

### Start Where YOU Are:

- **Have 30% coverage now?** Start with 35% threshold
- **Have 60% coverage?** Maybe aim for 65-70%
- **Have 5% coverage?** Start at 10% and celebrate progress!
- **Inherited legacy code?** Create a "Legacy" profile with realistic goals

**The goal is IMPROVEMENT, not perfection!** 📈

Use profiles to:
- Set achievable goals that match your current coverage
- Gradually increase thresholds over time
- Treat new code differently than legacy code
- Reflect your team's priorities (security, business logic, etc.)

You can customize these thresholds based on your team's standards.

### Step 3: Enable Coverage Collection

Add the following to your test project's `.csproj` file or create a `Directory.Build.props` in your test folder:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <CollectCoverage>true</CollectCoverage>
  <CoverletOutput>$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)/TestResults/coverage.json</CoverletOutput>
  <CoverletOutputFormat>json</CoverletOutputFormat>
  <EnableCoverBouncer>true</EnableCoverBouncer>
</PropertyGroup>
```

**Note:** If you don't have Coverlet installed yet, add it to your test project:

```bash
dotnet add package coverlet.msbuild
```

### Step 4: Tag Your Source Files (Optional!)

> **Untagged files use your `defaultProfile` automatically.** You can run CoverBouncer right now without any tags - all files will be checked against your default threshold. Add tags later only for files that need different thresholds.

You can tag files manually or use the automated CLI tools.

#### Option A: Manual Tagging

Add profile tags to your source files using comments at the top:

**Critical business logic:**
```csharp
// [CoverageProfile("Critical")]
namespace MyApp.PaymentProcessing
{
    public class PaymentService
    {
        // This class requires 100% coverage
    }
}
```

**DTOs that don't need testing:**
```csharp
// [CoverageProfile("Dto")]
namespace MyApp.Models
{
    public class CustomerDto
    {
        public int Id { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
    }
}
```

**Standard business logic:**
```csharp
// [CoverageProfile("BusinessLogic")]
namespace MyApp.Services
{
    public class CustomerService
    {
        // This class requires 90% coverage
    }
}
```

Files without tags will use the `defaultProfile` (Standard).

#### Option B: Automated Tagging with CLI

For bulk tagging, use the CLI tool. This is **much faster** for large projects!

**1. Interactive Mode** (Recommended for beginners):
```bash
dotnet coverbouncer tag --interactive

# Prompts you to:
# 1. Enter file pattern (e.g., **/*Service.cs)
# 2. Choose profile from list
# 3. Preview matching files
# 4. Confirm changes
```

**2. Auto-Suggest Mode** (Smart pattern detection):
```bash
dotnet coverbouncer tag --auto-suggest

# Automatically suggests profiles based on:
# - *Controller.cs → Integration
# - *Service.cs → BusinessLogic
# - Security/* → Critical
# - Models/* → Dto
# Then asks for confirmation
```

**3. Batch Mode** (For scripts and automation):
```bash
# Tag all service files
dotnet coverbouncer tag --pattern "**/*Service.cs" --profile BusinessLogic

# Tag entire directory
dotnet coverbouncer tag --path "./Security" --profile Critical

# Tag from file list
dotnet coverbouncer tag --files services.txt --profile Standard

# Preview without changing files
dotnet coverbouncer tag --pattern "**/*.cs" --profile Standard --dry-run

# Create backups before tagging
dotnet coverbouncer tag --pattern "**/*Service.cs" --profile Standard --backup
```

**4. Example Workflow:**
```bash
# Start with auto-suggest to tag most files
dotnet coverbouncer tag --auto-suggest

# Then manually adjust specific critical areas
dotnet coverbouncer tag --path "./Security" --profile Critical

# Preview what would change
dotnet coverbouncer tag --pattern "**/*Controller.cs" --profile Integration --dry-run

# Apply it
dotnet coverbouncer tag --pattern "**/*Controller.cs" --profile Integration
```

### Step 5: Run Your Tests

That's it! Just run your tests as normal:

```bash
dotnet test
```

Cover-Bouncer will automatically:
1. Collect coverage with Coverlet
2. Validate coverage against your policies
3. Fail the build if any files violate their thresholds

## Example Output

### Success (No Violations)
```
✓ All files meet coverage requirements
  - PaymentService.cs (Critical): 100% line coverage ✓
  - CustomerService.cs (BusinessLogic): 92% line coverage ✓
  - OrderService.cs (Standard): 75% line coverage ✓
```

### Failure (Violations Found)
```
✗ Coverage policy violations detected:

  PaymentService.cs (Critical)
    Required: 100% line coverage
    Actual:   85% line coverage
    Missing:  15 lines not covered

  CustomerService.cs (BusinessLogic)
    Required: 90% line coverage
    Actual:   78% line coverage
    Missing:  22 lines not covered

Build FAILED.
```

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions

Your existing test workflow already works! Just ensure the MSBuild properties are set:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Setup .NET
        uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3
        with:
          dotnet-version: '8.0'
      
      - name: Run tests
        run: dotnet test
        # Coverage policy automatically enforced!
```

**Set as Required Check:**
1. Go to repository Settings → Branches
2. Add branch protection rule for `main`
3. Require "test" job to pass before merging

Now PRs with coverage violations can't be merged! 🎉

### Azure DevOps

```yaml
trigger:
  - main

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:
- task: UseDotNet@2
  inputs:
    version: '8.0.x'

- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  displayName: 'Run tests with coverage'
  inputs:
    command: 'test'
```

Add this job as a required policy in branch policies.

### GitLab CI

```yaml
test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - dotnet test
  rules:
    - if: '$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"'
```

### ⚠️ Using `--filter` in CI? Read This!

If your CI pipeline uses `dotnet test --filter` for fast feedback (e.g., running only unit tests on PRs), CoverBouncer **automatically detects** the filter and skips files with 0% coverage.

**This means:**
- ✅ Filtered runs won't produce false failures for untargeted files
- ✅ Files that ARE targeted by the filter are still fully validated
- ⚠️ Only a **full run** (no `--filter`) validates ALL files against ALL thresholds

**Recommended CI pattern:**
```yaml
jobs:
  # Fast feedback — filtered run on every push
  quick-tests:
    steps:
      - run: dotnet test --filter "Category=Unit"
      # CoverBouncer validates only targeted files ✅
      # Untargeted files skipped (would show 0% from Coverlet instrumentation) ⏭️

  # Full coverage gate — on PRs or before merge
  coverage-gate:
    steps:
      - run: dotnet test
      # ALL files validated — this is your real coverage gate ✅
```

**Why both?** Filtered runs give developers fast feedback on the files they're working on. Full runs ensure nothing slips through. Think of it as "spot check vs full audit."

For more details on how filtered runs work, see [README - Filtered Test Runs](../README.md#-filtered-test-runs---filter).

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Report Paths

If your coverage report is in a different location:

```json
{
  "coverageReportPath": "coverage/results/coverage.json",
  "profiles": { ... }
}
```

### Disable in Local Development

Add to your `.csproj` or user-specific settings:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <EnableCoverBouncer Condition="'$(CI)' != 'true'">false</EnableCoverBouncer>
</PropertyGroup>
```

This disables enforcement locally but keeps it enabled in CI.

### Multiple Profiles

You can define as many profiles as you need:

```json
{
  "profiles": {
    "Critical": { "minLine": 1.00 },
    "High": { "minLine": 0.90 },
    "Medium": { "minLine": 0.70 },
    "Low": { "minLine": 0.50 },
    "Experimental": { "minLine": 0.00 },
    "Dto": { "minLine": 0.00 }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Coverage report not found"

Make sure:
1. Coverlet is installed: `dotnet add package coverlet.msbuild`
2. Coverage collection is enabled in your `.csproj`
3. The `CoverletOutput` path matches `coverageReportPath` in config

### "No profile tag found"

Files without tags use the `defaultProfile`. This is normal! Only tag files that need special thresholds.

### "Build passes locally but fails in CI"

Check that:
1. `coverbouncer.json` is committed to source control
2. MSBuild properties are in a committed file (not user-specific `.user` files)
3. Coverlet is properly configured

### Coverlet Warnings about CoverBouncer Assemblies

**This is fixed automatically!** CoverBouncer v1.0.0-preview.1 and later automatically exclude CoverBouncer assemblies from Coverlet instrumentation.

If you're seeing warnings like:
```
Instrumentation of assembly 'CoverBouncer.Core' failed
Unable to find module or source files
```

**Solution:** Update to the latest version of CoverBouncer.MSBuild. The exclusions are applied automatically via `buildTransitive` targets.

**Manual workaround** (if needed):
```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <Exclude>$(Exclude);[CoverBouncer.*]*</Exclude>
</PropertyGroup>
```

## Coverlet Best Practices

### Automatic Test Framework Exclusions

When you run `dotnet coverbouncer init`, you'll be prompted to exclude common test frameworks from coverage. This is **recommended** for:

- **Better performance**: Faster test execution
- **Cleaner reports**: Focus on your actual code
- **No warnings**: Eliminates missing symbols warnings

The init command will offer to add:
```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <Exclude>$(Exclude);[xunit.*]*;[FluentAssertions]*;[Moq]*;[NSubstitute]*</Exclude>
</PropertyGroup>
```

### Include Only Production Code

For maximum control, you can explicitly include only your production assemblies:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <!-- Only collect coverage on MyApp assemblies -->
  <Include>[MyApp]*;[MyApp.Core]*;[MyApp.Services]*</Include>
</PropertyGroup>
```

This approach:
- ✅ Ensures test code is never instrumented
- ✅ Improves performance significantly
- ✅ Makes coverage reports crystal clear

### Recommended Configuration

For most projects, use this pattern in `Directory.Build.props`:

```xml
<Project>
  <PropertyGroup Condition="'$(IsTestProject)' == 'true'">
    <!-- Enable Coverlet -->
    <CollectCoverage>true</CollectCoverage>
    <CoverletOutput>$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)/TestResults/coverage.json</CoverletOutput>
    <CoverletOutputFormat>json</CoverletOutputFormat>
    
    <!-- Enable CoverBouncer -->
    <EnableCoverBouncer>true</EnableCoverBouncer>
    
    <!-- Exclude test frameworks (CoverBouncer assemblies excluded automatically) -->
    <Exclude>$(Exclude);[xunit.*]*;[FluentAssertions]*;[Moq]*;[NSubstitute]*</Exclude>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

**Note:** CoverBouncer automatically adds `[CoverBouncer.*]*` to exclusions, so you don't need to include it manually.
