# 🚀 CoverBouncer Release Plan

## Phase 1: Local Package Testing ⏭️ NEXT

### Objective
Validate that NuGet packages work correctly in real-world scenarios before publishing.

### Steps

#### 1.1 CLI Tool Testing
- Install CLI tool globally from local package
- Verify command registration and help output
- Test `init` command in fresh directory
- Test `verify` command with real coverage report
- Test error handling (missing files, invalid JSON)
- Verify uninstall and reinstall workflow

#### 1.2 MSBuild Package Testing
- Create fresh test project outside CoverBouncer workspace
- Add local package source to NuGet.config
- Install CoverBouncer.MSBuild package
- Enable task via project property
- Generate real coverage with Coverlet
- Verify task executes automatically after test
- Test pass scenario (all coverage meets thresholds)
- Test fail scenario (coverage violations block build)
- Verify error messages are clear and actionable

#### 1.3 Integration Testing
- Test with .NET 6, 7, and 8 projects
- Test with xUnit, NUnit, and MSTest
- Test in solution with multiple test projects
- Test with CI/CD simulation (GitHub Actions locally)
- Verify package works in both Windows and Linux (WSL)

#### 1.4 Edge Case Testing
- Empty coverage report
- Malformed coverage.json
- Missing coverbouncer.json (should use defaults)
- Large projects (100+ files)
- Nested directory structures
- Files with special characters in paths

### Success Criteria
- ✅ CLI installs and runs without errors
- ✅ MSBuild task integrates seamlessly
- ✅ Clear error messages for common issues
- ✅ Works across .NET versions and test frameworks
- ✅ Performance acceptable for real projects
- ✅ No breaking behavior in CI/CD scenarios

### Time Estimate
2-3 hours of thorough testing

## Phase 2: Documentation & Polish 📝

### Objective
Ensure users can adopt CoverBouncer with minimal friction.

### Steps

#### 2.1 Documentation Review
- Verify README accuracy with actual packages
- Ensure getting-started.md matches real workflow
- Update configuration.md with all options
- Add troubleshooting section for common issues
- Create migration guide for similar tools

#### 2.2 Package Metadata
- Review package descriptions and tags
- Verify license and repository URLs
- Add release notes for v1.0.0-preview.1
- Ensure icon/logo if available
- Check package size and dependencies

#### 2.3 Example Projects
- Verify examples/SampleProject works end-to-end
- Add comments explaining configuration
- Ensure it demonstrates key features
- Test from user perspective (no prior knowledge)

### Success Criteria
- ✅ User can install and configure in <5 minutes
- ✅ Documentation answers common questions
- ✅ Example project runs successfully
- ✅ Package metadata is professional

### Time Estimate
1-2 hours

- ✅ Validation scenarios comprehensive
- ✅ Code quality high
- ✅ Well-structured codebase

### Medium Risk
- ⚠️ Real-world edge cases not yet discovered
- ⚠️ Performance on very large projects unknown
- ⚠️ User adoption/interest uncertain

### Mitigation
- Preview release limits blast radius
- Clear labeling as preview/beta
- Active monitoring and quick response
- Gather feedback before v1.0.0 commitment
